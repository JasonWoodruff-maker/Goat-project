          My Mom is my goat for millions of reasons; One of those reasons is
          that she always believed in me even when I thought no one did. My Mom
          was always very supportive of everything I did especially sports and
          school, she would never let me give up on my dream which is why I have
          made it so far in school and everything else in my life. Even if I
          haven't been the best in a ton of ways, she looks right past that and
          makes me feel like everything is safe and the reason people make
          mistakes is for them and others to learn from them.
