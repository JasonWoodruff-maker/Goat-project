          My Mom is my goat for millions of reasons; One of those reasons is
          that she always believed in me even when I was down and not feeling
          like I should get back up. My Mom was always very supportive of
          everything I did especially sports and school, she would never let me
          give up on my dream which is why I have made it so far in school and
          everything else in my life. Even if I haven't been the best in a ton
          of ways, she looks right past that and makes me feel like everything
          is safe and the reason people make mistakes is for them and others to
          learn from them.
